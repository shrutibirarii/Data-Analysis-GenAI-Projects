This repository showcases end-to-end projects combining Data Analysis, Cloud (AWS), Storage/Backup Systems, and Generative AI (GenAI).These projects demonstrate my ability to:

• Analyze large datasets using Python, SQL, and Excel

• Build interactive Power BI dashboards

• Automate reporting with GenAI-powered insights

• Translate IT operations (Storage, Backup, AWS) into business-focused analytics
